## Topic: Extract Data from Photos
Create an interface for users to annotate pictures from photo surveys to distill higher level data about bird count (possibly species).

- When:  Saturday 11 August 2018  ??am - ??pm
  - Code for America: [National Day of Civic Hacking](https://www.codeforamerica.org/events/national-day-of-civic-hacking)
- Where: ???
- Who: Anybody and Everybody 


## Main Pieces

1. Photo Management (Pre-annotation) 
2. Annotation Tool
3. Creation of analyzable data

## Pre-Annotation

1. __Photo Management__ (Pre-annotation) 
    - Photo file management 
    - Database with meta/covariates for pictures
    - Sampling frame
      - Tiling?
      - Repeatition?
      - Randomization?
    - Spooling process to the _Annotation Tool_
2. Annotation Tool
3. Creation of analyzable data

## Annotaiton Tool

1. _Photo Management_ 
2. __Annotation Tool__
    - User Iterface (UI)
    - Annotation Mechanism (UI)
    - Usability (UX)
    - Documentation 
    - Export to _Database_
3. Creation of analyzable data

## Distilled Data

1. _Photo Management_ 
2. _Annotation Tool_
3. Creation of analyzable data
    - Table(s) compatiable with Database hoding photo info
    - Multiple Reader Comparission Tool
    - Relate annotation back to orginal file (i.e. not just the tile)
    - Update and inform _spooling process_ from before

## Conclusion

- Lots of pieces, but all seem managable.
- There are non-coding tasks.
- Techinical Skills Needed:
    - Database: Postgres / SQL
    - Interface:  Java or Pyhton / Interface Design / Documentation
    - Data product: above database skills / Python or R
